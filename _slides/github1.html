# Getting to Know Version Control
### Sara Cope
---
## Agenda

* Give a brief explanation of version control
* Explain the difference between Git and GitHub
* Discuss examples of how version control can be used for different projects
* Navigate GitHub and checkout it's features
<!--- Presenter notes:
By the end of this session, you should have a basic understanding of what version control is and how you might use it within your teams.
You'll be familiar with GitHub and be able to do some basic tasks like navigating a GitHub repository and entering an issue.

## Version Control to the rescue!

<!--- Presenter notes:
Using version control, you can easily view the revision history of your source code to track changes and quickly go back in time to learn about the differences between different versions of your files. And there's no need to create manual backups, it's done for you.
You're also able to share your work with 2, 20, or 200+ collaborators.

### Version Control Basics
Allows you (and your team) to do 2 powerful things:
#### 1. Track and rollback changes
#### 2. Collaborate together

## Version control types
--
### Centralized version control

One central server, each client (person) checkouts out and merges changes to main server

Examples: CVS, SVN
--
### Distributed version control

Each client (person) has a local copy of the project, which they can then link to the main project

  Examples: Git, Mercurial

## Let's Talk About Git
* Commonly used in gov
* Distributed version control system
* Originally developed to manage Linux source code
* Use it from the command line
<!--- Presenter notes:
Git is the versional control system you will probably see most often used in government and at GSA right now. We're not going to deep-dive on Git specifics, but I want you to understand how it is different from GitHub.

## What is GitHub
* Website that hosts your project files online
* Provides a visual, web-based interface to Git
* Gives you an up-front GUI and does the Git work behind the scene for you
* Facilitates social collaboration
* Has tons of extra features to use for teams and projects
<!--- Presenter notes:
Github is like facebook for programmers. Everyone’s on there. You can look at what they’re working on and easily peruse their code and make suggestions or changes.
It’s really open source. “Open source” is not so open if you can’t easily study it. With github, all of the code is easily inspected, as is its entire history.
Github lowers the barriers to collaboration. It’s easy to offer suggested changes to others’ code through github. I fixed some problems in some very useful code developed by someone I don’t know, because it’s hosted on github.
You don’t have to set up a git server. --->
