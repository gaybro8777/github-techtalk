## Version Control to the rescue!

<!--- Presenter notes:
Using version control, you can easily view the revision history of your source code to track changes and quickly go back in time to learn about the differences between different versions of your files. And there's no need to create manual backups, it's done for you.
You're also able to share your work with 2, 20, or 200+ collaborators.

## Version Control Basics
Version control allows you (and your team) to do 2 powerful things:
#### 1. Track and rollback changes
#### 2. Collaborate together

#### 1. Track and rollback changes
Mistakes happen. Wouldn't it be nice if you could see the changes that have been made and "go back in time" to fix something that wasn't quite right?
<!--- Presenter notes:
Using version control is like creating an insurance policy for your work.

#### 2. Collaborate
Create anything with other people, from policy documents to entire websites and applications

### Version control types
#### Centralized version control
Examples: CVS, SVN
One central server, each client (person) checkouts out and merges changes to main server

--
### Version control types
#### Distributed version control
Examples: Git, Mercurial
Each client (person) has a local repository, which they can then reconcile with the main server

## Git
* Commonly used in gov
* Distributed version control system
* Originally developed to manage Linux source code
* Access from the command line
<!--- Presenter notes:
Git is the versional control system you will probably see most often used in government and at GSA right now. We're not going to deep-dive on Git specifics, but I want you to understand how it is different from GitHub.
